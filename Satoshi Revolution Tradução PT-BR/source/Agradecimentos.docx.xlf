Mate Tokay is a masterful coordinator for all things Bitcoin.com and for preserving both the wider context of the operation as well as its minutia. Editor-in- Chief Nanok Bie’s decades in journalism was invaluable. Marcel Chou is a patient editor who has become a trusted friend and sounding board. What I’ve come to call “the Bitcoin Guys” never once tried to influence the theories being tested and hypotheses floated in print. I thank them all.<x id="7"/>Jeff Tucker, author of the Preface, has been a highly valued associate of mine for many years; he could not have been more encouraging about the articles as they appeared. To his credit, Jeff caught on faster than I did to the extraordinary implications cryptocurrency has for freedom. My evolution to understanding also owes a debt to other people too numerous to list.
