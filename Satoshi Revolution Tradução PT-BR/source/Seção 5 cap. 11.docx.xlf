<source xml:lang="en">Despite the word “justice” appearing in both terms, the goals of free-market and state justice are incompatible. One empowers the individual; the other centralizes power in the hands of authority. Free-market justice is the full realization of an individual’s right to self-defense; state justice destroys the right of self-defense by centralizing it in the hands of authority. The situation is similar to that in the financial realm. Crypto and the blockchain allow individuals to become self- bankers and to control their own finances; fiat and central banking allow the state to monopolize finance and take control from individuals.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">Private justice is distinct from divine justice, the two of which are sometimes conflated. Divine justice envisions a deity or some other ultimate power that weighs each person’s worth on a scale and allocates good fortune on the basis of the reading. “Why me, Oh Lord, why me?” is the cry of someone who believes he has been betrayed by divine justice. The theory underlying this cry is that there is something beyond the non-initiation of force that a good person is entitled to demand of the world: good health, for example. When bad things happen instead, the situation is called “unjust.” The word is either being used colloquially or being misused. Perhaps a better word would be “unlucky.”</source>

<source xml:lang="en">The content of private justice rests on two principles. The first is the non-initiation of force, which is a restatement of a person’s duty to respect the self-ownership of others; justice resides in living together in peace. The second principle is contract law by which a person voluntarily exchanges with another. The justice here resides in each person receiving whatever has been agreed upon. When justice does not occur, a remedy is required. Neither a breach of contract nor its remedy have to involve violence, however. A breach does not even have to be a person’s fault; it could be occasioned by an unexpected change of circumstance. But the person who is disadvantaged by the breach still has a right to be made whole.</source>

<source xml:lang="en">That is where the right to justice begins and ends, however. There is a common confusion about justice. Namely, it is often called “unjust” when one party treats another with disrespect or hostility. This assumes that one person can have an enforceable claim to another person’s attitude. No such claim exists; there is only the right to live without being molested and to the fulfillment of a contract. A seller who is rude to a buyer is unlikely to have repeat business, and this is a strong incentive for him to be civil. But the seller’s only duty under justice is to be nonviolent and honest in the exchange, not to manifest the correct attitude while doing so. As Rothbard writes, “It is not the business of the law to make anyone good or reverent or moral or clean or upright.”</source>

In his book The Structure of Liberty, Barnett argues that law should be privately administered, with any inefficiencies addressed by the free market. Part of the efficiency of proprietary justice derives from its sheer simplicity and the minimal number of laws. Barnett writes of the current system, “Every dollar spent to punish a drug user or seller is a dollar that cannot be spent collecting restitution from a robber. Every hour spent investigating a drug user or seller is an hour that could have been used to find a missing child. Every trial held to prosecute a drug user or seller is court time that could be used to prosecute a rapist.” Barnett argues that private law is the solution to the inevitable corruption of vested interests and monopolies.</source>

Ethical and practical issues arise. A common ethical issue: what about the individual rights of those forced to provide restitution? A common response: anyone who violates the rights of another relinquishes his own to the proportional degree of the harm inflicted and until this harm is rectified. A common practical issue: restitution invites the participation of a trusted third party. In state law, the third party consists of state agents who often use violence. In proprietary or free-market law, the third party consists of free-market agents who are restrained by dynamics like the use of proportional force and the need to preserve a good reputation.

The blockchain can also fulfill a requirement of law—namely, it is an instrument of enforcement in and of itself. When it does so, it is called a smart contract—a self-executing contract. A recent U.S. Senate report states, “The concept [of smart contracts] is rooted in basic contract law. Usually, the judicial system adjudicates contractual disputes and enforces terms...With smart contracts, a program enforces the contract built into the code.” Smart contracts offer the same opportunity to avoid the trusted third parties of lawyers and state courts as crypto avoids central banks.

<source xml:lang="en">Paying attention to fraud is warranted, of course, but the problem requires more than attention. It requires a due diligence on the part of users that cannot be legislated. Consider the 2017 “mybtgwallet.com” scam. Mybtgwallet.com offered users free online Bitcoin Gold wallets through which they could check their balances and conduct free transactions for a limited time. The wallet was a fraud but it was lent credibility by briefly appearing on the official Bitcoin Gold site—an act of extreme carelessness at best on this site’s part. To take mybtgwallet.com up on its offer, users had to submit their private keys or recovery seeds. A scam link was a hidden aspect of the process. After unwary users accepted mybtgwallet’s offer, the crypto in their wallets was forwarded to other addresses. According to Coindesk, “more than $3.3 million has been stolen as part of an elaborate scam that took advantage of bitcoin users seeking to claim their share of the newly created cryptocurrency bitcoin gold. At least $30,000 in ethereum, $72,000 in litecoin, $107,000 in bitcoin gold and more than $3 million in bitcoin were confiscated.”</source>

The fact they did so does not mean “they had it coming”; this is not the message here. A person with cash bulging out of his pockets may decide to sleep off a binge in a back alley behind the bar. His choice is foolish and dangerous, but it does not make him legally responsible if the cash is stolen. He would be the victim of a crime. Unfortunately, those who hand private keys over to strangers do the equivalent of sleeping in a back alley with bulging pockets. Such people would be well advised to develop caveat emptor habits. Part of ownership in a predatory world is to decentralize self-defense, including the defense of property.</source>

One reason people can be prone to fraud is because they approach wealth and investing with a statist mindset. That is, they are accustomed to guarantees of safety from the state. Those guarantees are illusions, but this does not matter; what matters to people’s behavior is that they believe in the guarantees. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures the money that a person deposits into a bank for up to $250,000. Law enforcement operates fraud divisions that records reports of the crime. In short, the state makes people feel safer than they should, and this makes them neglect due diligence. The state induces people to relinquish their sense of responsibility.</source>
